**The goals of this project was to:**
  -1. to understand important Unix system calls**
  -2. to develop a simple shell application**

The application is intended as a shell (command line interpreter) that accepts input from the user and executes the commands that are given. It will be most similar to the well-known shell * *bash* *.

The shell is able to execute commands, redirect standard input or standard output to files, pipe output of commands to other commands, and executes commands in the background.
